# GGUF_loader

Provides a GGUF model loader and parser to facilitate reading llm model params from dist to memory.

It's modified from [llama.cpp with tag:b4721](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b4721), we removed irrelevant code and keep the interface simple.

## TODO List:
~~- Run and pass the gguf test~~
- Simplify the code and remove the ggml calculation code
- Simplify the inferface
